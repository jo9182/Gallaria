A flash of light… weightlessness…
My senses are overloaded as I begin free-falling. I hear people screaming around me and loud sounds below. I try to get my bearings but whip around in the air instead. I manage to look down before—
***CRACK!***
I grunt in pain, I land in something relatively soft, and I look to the side to see what broke my fall. Lifeless eyes meet my gaze, I scream and push away causing me to tumble down a pile of bodies, I can feel some exposed bones cut me as I fall. After tumbling down the pile I hear people running, metal clashing, people shouting and crying. There’s also a splitting pain in my head which brilliant flashes of light and loud explosions around me are definitely contributing to.

Something approaches me and I begin to scramble away from it, everything is blurry and I can’t quite make out what it is as I look at it. A soft voice calls out and my vision starts to get clearer, a woman is kneeling in front of me. She’s inspecting me, which warrants me to look down. I look horrendous, there’s blood staining my clothes and open wounds are covering my body. As I see this I start to feel again, searing pain flies through my body and I start screaming. 

The woman sighs and gently places her hand on my chest, I try to move away, but the pain begins to subside and many of the smaller wounds mend. I look at her with a mixture of awe and bewilderment, which rouses a giggle from her. Unintelligible noises exit her mouth and I give her a confused look. She sighs and shakes her head before moving her hand from my chest to my forehead. The headache I had reignites and I groan. Knowledge enters my head, and words and phrases I don’t understand enter my head. Everything feels like it's spinning briefly as nonsense dances in my head, but something clicks and all the knowledge suddenly makes sense. 

I’m clutching at my head, but I manage to sputter out, “The fuck?”

The woman chuckles. “You haven’t seen magic before, have you? I’d bet so, considering you’re an otherworlder,” She glances up at the sky before shaking her head, “The process for language is never pleasant,” Her voice is smooth and angelic. Judging by how she’s looking at me, I believe I have a funny look on my face. She continues, “My name is Allea-” she’s cut off as the bodies I’m lying against begin to shift. As they do she grimaces and turns to yell, “Someone torch this pile! Quick!”

As she yells she grabs me and pulls me to my feet, I wobble for a few moments, but I start moving as she drags me. As we begin moving the pile I was lying against starts shifting, and loud pops and cracks can be heard. The corpses start to move, but I hear a crack and a ball of fire flies straight into the pile. Chunks of flesh and shards of bone from the pile fly outwards, and the smell of burning skin and hair fills the air. It’s rather disgusting, but… it smells familiar. 

I stare at the now-charred pile of corpses for a few moments before I feel Allea tug on my arm again, “Come on, there are tents behind the battle. It’d be better for you to catch your bearings there.”

Due to me being rather overwhelmed I just follow her silently. As we walk she occasionally stops and assists a few soldiers who have fallen; I end up relocating a couple of corpses to piles which end up being burnt shortly after I put a body in them. Despite everything, the battle currently happening is quite a spectacle. Occasionally I glance behind me and see people throwing their hands upwards and twisting their fingers in unnatural ways, this is often accompanied by brilliant flashes of light.

Once we make it behind the battle with a few people in tow I follow her to a canvas tent and enter, many people are lying in cots. Almost all of their clothes are stained with blood, but no one has any visible wounds. As we enter a few people dressed in robes similar to Allea see us and get a couple of the people out of their cots. They grumble but comply, getting out of their cots and exiting the tent. 

After this happens I help the few people we brought along into the now available cots. As I do she starts to inspect their wounds before squinting and waving her hands over them. As she does a soft light washes over them and their wounds are healed.

Now having a better grip on everything, I pipe up, “That’s a neat trick, could I learn how to do that?”

She finishes healing the last person and nods, “You could! It’d be a bit more difficult for you to learn though.” She places a hand on her chest, “I’m a manabound caster. You would be a spellbound caster.” She pauses and hums to herself for a few moments before continuing, “Here, try doing this.”

She raises her hand, palm raised to the ceiling. Her fingers then bend in ways that are most definitely not healthy and a small orb of light appears above her palm. I gawk at the orb for a few moments before trying to do the same thing, though my fingers don’t quite want to listen. I sigh, “That’s not happening. How the hell are your fingers bending like that? Also, if I need to do this to do your… magic? Then how were you healing those men without doing that?”

She smiles and responds, “Oh, that’s because I’m a manabound spellcaster! I have my own reserve of mana and can use it without calling upon the world. The hand gestures are for calling upon the world, which is spellbound casting. Both types of casting have their advantages, but you’re likely stuck with spellbound casting due to you not having a mana reserve.” She stops talking for a few moments before her eyes start faintly glowing. She shakes her head and speaks, “Nope, no mana reserve whatsoever. There *is* a strange empty space where mana is flowing differently, but I think that has something to do with you being an otherworlder.”

I frown and sigh, “So… I have to do the weird hand gestures? I don’t think I can manage that.”

Her head tilts slightly and a confused look spreads across her face, “Are you tight-fingered?” She brings one hand up to the other, grabs a finger, and bends it back fully resulting in her finger touching the back of her hand, “Can you not do this?”

I just stare at her hand for a few moments before attempting to copy what she did, I definitely can’t. She looks troubled and speaks, “That’s no good, I can’t really do much about that. You won’t be able to do spellbound magic or really any magic right now unless you get a mana transfusion.” She holds up a finger towards me, “Now, no more questions, please. I have people to tend to.”

She walks over to a couple of people dressed similarly to her before they start bringing new sets of clothes to some of the soldiers. I watch for a few moments before walking over to the canvas tent and poking my head out. The sun is lower in the sky, the battle has died down a bit, and some of the soldiers on both sides in the center of the battlefield are withdrawing. There are more people walking through the camp, some of them give me a curt nod as they pass. It appears they’re gathering near a large canvas canopy, smoke is billowing out from under it.

I bring my head back into the tent and turn towards Allea. I ask, “Is that food the soldiers are gathering around?”

She nods, “Yes, that is food. Feel free to go grab some, they shouldn’t deny you any. If they do, please tell me.”

I respond, also nodding, “Alright… are you not going to get any food?”

She shakes her head, “Not at the moment, I still need to tend to soldiers, there’s likely to be a wave of injured people now that many soldiers are withdrawing for the night.”

I start to walk towards the exit of the tent and speak, “Make sure you don’t overexert yourself and get something to eat.”

She grabs a few vials full of some strange, colorful liquid and chuckles, “Of course, I’m not a fool.”
